/**
 * ConcurrencyManager is used to handle concurrency for objects.
 * Depending on the lock type, locking has different semantics:
 * - Optimistic locks can be aquired on the same object by different users.
 *   This lock quarantees that an exception is thrown, if the user tries
 *   to persist an object, which another used has updated, since the user
 *   retrieved it.
 * - Pessimistic (write) locks can be aquired on the same object only by one
 *   user. This lock quarantees that no other user can modify the object
 *   until the lock is released.
 * A user can only aquire one lock on each object. An exeption is thrown,
 * if a user tries to aquire a lock on an object on which another user
 * already owns a pessimistic lock.
