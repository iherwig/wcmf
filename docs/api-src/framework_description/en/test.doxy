# Testing # {#testing}

The tests shipping with wCMF are based on [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). They
are located in the _src/wcmf/test_ directory.

## Running tests ## {#testing_run}

Before running the tests the code generator is used to generate the environment:

<div class="shell">
```
$ cd src/wcmf/test/model & ant
```
</div>

To run all tests, execute the following command in the _src/wcmf/test_ directory:

<div class="shell">
```
$ phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php --configuration configuration.xml
```
</div>

The tests use PHP's built-in web server where necessary and operate on a file
based database ([SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)).

## Writing tests ## {#testing_write}

To simplify setting up the testing enviroment, wCMF provides the
\link wcmf::lib::util::TestUtil `TestUtil`\endlink class. It has methods for
starting the test server, initializing the framework, starting sessions and
simulating requests.

For developing custom test cases, the following base classes are provided:

- \link wcmf::test::lib::BaseTestCase `BaseTestCase`\endlink is used as
  base class for all test cases. It initializes the framework before each test.
- \link wcmf::test::lib::DatabaseTestCase `DatabaseTestCase`\endlink adds
  database support for testing persistency related functionality.
- \link wcmf::test::lib::ControllerTestCase `ControllerTestCase`\endlink
  adds a convenience method for running requests.
- \link wcmf::test::lib::SeleniumTestCase `SeleniumTestCase`\endlink is used to
  run tests with [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).
